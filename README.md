The Daily profit calculator, calculates how much profit you need to make a day. 
There are three things you need to fill in
- The starting capital you have for trading
- The amount of interest you want to earn
- The amount of days you want a overview for

We made this project because you dont need to greed to make profit,

> When you doubt, zoom out

> When there is a dump, there is a pump
> 
> When i give you an all time high, i give you a time to buy
> 
> If you not apraise me at 50000 you dont deserve me at 60000

> Bulls get profit, bears get profit, pigs get slaughtered
